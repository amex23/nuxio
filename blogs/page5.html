				Having a leaky sales funnel is one of the prominent problems that every business may face today. If you’re one of those who want to find funnel drop-offs and fix the problem but don’t know where to start, that’s where conversion rate optimization comes in. It’s a way to increase the number of people who complete your desired action to get more out of existing traffic and leads. As a result, you generate more revenue and boost your conversion rate.
				<br><br> 

				In this guide, we delve into what CRO is, what’s the process in WordPress, and how to increase website conversion rate.<br><br> 

				Note: Improving website conversion rate is an ongoing process. If you want to make sure that whether you deliver an outstanding user experience that will lead to increased conversion rates or not, you need a behavior analytics tool like WatchThemLive. This tool helps you understand how your users move through your website and what’s distracting them from completing your goal; so you can fix your website’s pain points and ultimately improve website conversion rate.<br><br>  

				What Is Conversion Rate Optimization?<br>
				Conversion rate optimization (CRO) is an evolutionary process of increasing conversion rate by persuading more visitors to complete your desired action. This desired action can be purchasing a product, signing up for a service, or clicking on a link. You might know how to make a website professionally, but if you can’t work on CRO, it will be hard to grow.<br><br>

				Why CRO Is Important
				What Is CRO Process In WordPress?
				WordPress is a platform that makes your conversion rate optimization process easier by managing your content. Here are the steps you need to take for the CRO of WordPress websites:<br><br>

				1. Identify Pages You Need to Optimize for Conversion
				The first step you need to take is to identify which elements on your website need optimization. Website optimization is important because it highly impacts your Google ranking. So if you want Google to make you visible among the millions of websites, you must optimize your website. Focus on the elements below to improve your ranking:<br><br> 

				Keywords<br>
				Images<br>
				URL structure<br>
				Meta descriptions<br>
				Page titles<br> 
				Imagine you want to optimize your landing page to realize whether your CTAs works well or not, first, you need a behavior analytics tool to track all the events on your page. WatchThemLive’s page optimization enables you to test your website performance. So you can identify the problem and fix it in order to provide better user experience and increase your conversions.<br><br>

				2. Establish a Baseline
				A baseline is “a fixed point of reference used for comparison purposes.” Before you start optimizing, you need to pay attention to the previous performance of your website, and that’s where you can establish a baseline in line with your conversion statistics and improve your conversion rate over a while.<br><br> 

				3. Identify and Disrupt the Barries
				After selecting a particular page for optimization, check your conversion funnel to find your drop-off points. Segregating the conversion funnel allows you to identify where users abandoned your website; so you can fix them or implement small changes to provide better user experience.<br><br> 

				Sometimes, you may test your conversion funnel, but still, you can’t find the reason to its  l leaks. Here, you can test your CTAs to understand what is stopping users from clicking on them using heatmaps. WatchThemLive’s heatmaps enable you to test your web design and visualize visitor behavior in the form of hot and cold spots. If your heatmap shows red spots on your CTA, it means people clicked on it, and it works perfectly; if it shows green or blue spots, it means people couldn’t find it, or it’s not clickable.<br><br>

				4. Repeat the Process
				As far as you know, CRO is an endless process. You can’t rely on pre-set conversion rate optimization strategies because, in this fast-changing world, a small change in the industry trends can impact businesses and the masses. So you need to repeat the process over and over.
